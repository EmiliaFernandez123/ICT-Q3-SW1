            <h4 style="font-weight: bold;" class="text-info">SYNOPSIS</h4>
            <p>Inside Job is a satirical, exaggerated and comedic portrayal of reality. It revolves around secret deep state called "Cognito Inc.", which manages their society's various controversies from the shadows. We get to see this through the lens of Reagen's team. The show uses comedy to tackle somewhat dark topics, without being too offensive. Despite the complex plot, the story likes to focus more on the characters in the team, as each have their own personality, we get to see how these different characters with different opinions interact with each other.</p>

<p><font size="4"> 
Reagen Ridley is their company, Cognito Inc.'s, finest robotics enginner, leading up to her promotion as boss in her team. She is the main character. She is an incredibly intelligent woman, and portrays the results and trauma of emotionally unstable parents. She is depicted as an overworked, afraid of intimacy and self-destructive person. Throughout the show, we see how her work life intertwines with her personal life, her work usually getting in the way of healthy relationships.  <br><br>

<p><font size="4">
<br>Brett Hand is the quickly assigned Co-owner or co-boss of Reagen's team, initially given the role by J.R, Cognito Inc's CEO. He was originally introduced as someone to support and keep Reagen stable in her leadership of the team, but over time, we get alot more insight on who he is as a person. He's bubbly, extroverted and kind. But underneath all these, we see results of layers of childhood trauma from neglectful parents, and how emotional and sensitive this man really is.</br>
